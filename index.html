            <p>Dear Malka Maren L. Luna <br><br>
              I hope this letter finds you well, I have been thinking of doing this for quite some time and finally have done it. 
              This might not be the most perfect letter basing makulang or something but I’ll do my best. I thought that when we broke up, 
              I would never find love again, but then God had other plans, He lead me back to you. Ever since those times I have been 
              reflecting about everything that I did wrong and trying to correct the bad sides and I think I’m doing great. I discovered 
              I’m not the same depressed and immature guy you met but a better version, a version that will do everything to make things 
              right and hopefully what I’m saying will translate to my actions.
              <br><br>
              We always overlook the fact nga sa 4 times nga we tried to go no contact 3 of those times you were the first one to shoot a message, 
              it was such a big deal to me because I kept manifesting it hoping nga you’d chat first, and then you actually did. All the waiting 
              was very much worth it in the end. I’m not saying nga I didn’t like it, of course gikilig si idol mo noh. From that December night I 
              knew I had the chance of getting you back and I did, although dili pa official because you know, but hopefully soon enough. It gave 
              the struggling me hope at another shot of love. I am grateful gyud nga imo ko giaccept balik because I would never think that this 
              would happen. This is my redemption arc, my second shot of making it right with you and as what stoick said “you’re as beautiful as 
              the day I lost you” HAHAHAHAHA and I could never relate more. You were not the toxic person you were describing yourself; you are 
              still the sweetest, kindest, loving, and hardworking woman that I knew and loved and I’m happy and excited for the opportunity that 
              you’ve given me. I promise nga I will not fumble this time and I will do my best to keep you safe.
              <br><br>
              I find myself sitting down on my table and typing (cause I’m not writing) this letter and I can’t stop thinking about the things about 
              you that make me happy, isa na ang cute and fun stories that you have in store for me, the way you explain makes me giggle. Kanang mga 
              kalit kalit nimo nga mga expressions, your jokes and especially the times when we talk about our problems and what’s bothering us regarding 
              our relationship. Nothing is sexier than a woman who can communicate properly and resolve issues this way. Plus, the way you’re working 
              so hard in school makes me admire you more, your small giggles and smiles makes me smile and giggle HAHAHAHAHAAH. I wish in the future we 
              could go on adventures, just the two of us, I wish that our plans will come true and will give us the life that we've always wanted and that
              would make us happy.
              <br><br>
              I appreciate you a lot my love you’ve gone through so many shit to become the person you are today, the person I proudly say is 
              the love my life and the person I want to spend my life with, the person I look up to, and the person I’m always proud of. I will 
              always be appreciative and grateful for your kindness towards me and all the things that we’ve done together. Keep up the hardwork my love 
              I will always be inspired by your hardwork and dedication for your future and that I will always be here to support you dear no matter what.
              I will always be your hypeman. I hope that you will have great day ahead filled with love and happiness, I love you so much dear Malka Luna. MWAAAAA
